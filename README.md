# FusionCharSheet
A character sheet layout for a custom TTRPG played on Roll20.com

The game, Fusion, is based on several established TTRPGs. As it draws influence from different games, a unique character sheet is required to manage all of the relevant information in it.

## Dice Rolls
Roll20 provides built in functionality that can be customised through both HTML and CSS. By use of a button, several custom macros can be fired, performing pseudo-random dice rolls. 
These are typically all based off of the player characters attributes that are set in game ahead of time.

For example, a character may wish to arm a block of C4 explosives. This would requires use of the "Demolition" skill that the player can invest skill points in.
The higher their skill level means they have a smaller chance of failure.

Dice rolls, regarding this particular skill, are d100 based. The GM sets a threshold and the player must roll below that threshold to have their action succeed.
So arming a block of C4 would be relatively simple, so the threshold would be set as '20'. A player with a skill level of '10' in demolitions would essentially have a +10 bonus to the score of their roll.
